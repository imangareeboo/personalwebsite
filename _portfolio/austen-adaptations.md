excerpt: "An Ongoing Project Cataloguing Adaptations of Jane Austen's Corpus"

This project aimed at testing out what a comprehensive website cataloguing adaptations of Jane Austen's corpus across text, film, tv series, web series', fanfiction, and online games would look like. The data on Austen adaptations is still being created for this website, so this project, using the Hitchens theme forked from Github, is test to explore one method for displaying this data. It was done in 2023, as part of a digital humanities class. 

It is, unfortunately, not a perfect example; there are broken links and coding issues, which has led me to focus on creating an Excel doc as a repository for the data. I am currently looking into the methods that the McGill and Chawton House project *Reading with Austen* used to display their information (although this a far more advanced method).
